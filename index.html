        <h2>The Future is Here: New Millennium Brings Revolutionary Computers</h2>
        <p>The dawn of the new millennium is bringing exciting changes to the world of personal computing. As we say goodbye to the 1990s and enter 1999, computers are getting more powerful and versatile than ever before.
          The new Intel Pentium III processor is pushing the limits of what a desktop computer can do. With speeds up to 700MHz, the Pentium III gives users lightning fast processing for all their applications. 3D graphics and video editing have never been smoother. Intel promises the Pentium III will take PC users well into the next decade.
          Laptop computers are also getting a major upgrade. New lightweight notebooks weighing under 5 pounds are hitting the market with <strong>CD-ROM</strong> drives and 10+ hour battery life. Models like the IBM ThinkPad and Dell Inspiron 3000 are bringing full desktop functionality on the go. Laptops may finally be powerful enough to replace traditional desktops for average users.

          Another hot trend is the rise of the <strong>Internet</strong> and online services. America Online recently reached 10 million subscribers to its popular dial-up service. With easy to use interfaces, people from all backgrounds are getting hooked on browsing the ever-expanding World Wide Web. Experts estimate web use will grow over 1000% in the coming years.</p>
